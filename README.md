# Simple-GD-Api
A simple Geometry Dash API I made in Node.js.

## Info
I made this api in 1 whole day. You can get infomation about levels, users, and songs.

If you make any improvements or add any new functions to the api, gladly make a pull request.<br/>
If you notice any issues, gladly report it in the Issues tab in this repository.<br/>
If you wanna make a suggestion, make it as a issue. (btw if you were wondering, making a suggestion as a issue in the repository doesnt make it a issue.)

## How to use
You can look in the javascript files (except levelComments.js cause it's stil work in progress)

## Documention
You can take a look at the documention on the [wiki](https://github.com/willycoffee/Simple-GD-Api/wiki).

## Example
A example for a level
```javascript
getLevel(128)
```

A example for a user
```javascript
getUser(71)
```

A example for a song
```javascript
getSong(467339)
```

## Credits
