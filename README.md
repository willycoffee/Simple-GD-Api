# Simple-GD-Api
A simple Geometry Dash API I made in Node.js.

# Info
I made this api in 1 whole day. You can get infomation about levels, users, and songs.

# How to use
You can look in the javascript files (except levelComments.js cause it's stil work in progress)

# Documention
I'll make a documention in the wiki of this repo soon don't worry.

# Example
A example for a level
```
getLevel(128)
```

A example for a user
```
getUser(71)
```

A example for a song
```
getSong(467339)
```

# Credits
